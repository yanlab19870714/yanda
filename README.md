# Why this Webpage?

From 2020, UAB would like to use a uniform website format for branding purpose: https://sites.uab.edu/

However, the format is fixed using WordPress and so my old plain HTML pages cannot transfer easily; I also have no time to customize the new WordPress site while default display is not ideal

The old department website is scheduled to go offline and so I am setting up this website as a mirror of the old department website.

This is the major site that I actively maintain. Other sites will be linked to here.
